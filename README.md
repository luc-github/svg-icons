3D Printer and Network related SVG icons v 0.0.1

Set of icons designed with inkscape to be used for 3D printers applications, and integrated in font package for convenience.

In many projects I handle, I always miss 3D printer related icons and even some network icons, so I decided to take time to build a set. 

The first sets are simple and black. 
* Network icons
* 3D Printer icons

The idea is to have one place to store and improve icons, I am not graphical designer so be patient ^_^ , I need time to get the right design and master the svg and font tools:
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)
* [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io)

Feel free to suggest any improvement.   

* The base font will be [roboto font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) because currently used by [littlevgl](https://littlevgl.com/) using range from 0x20 to 0x7F
* The base glyphes will be from [feathericons](https://feathericons.com/), because I plan to use them in my web-ui project, 
using range from 0xF000 to ???, I did not identified yet the ones which need to be integrated.

One of the goal is to generate a font that can be integrated in [littlevgl](https://littlevgl.com/) using [online converter](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_font_conv) or [offline converter](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_font_conv)
