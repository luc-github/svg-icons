3D Printer and related SVG icons

Set of icons designed with inkscape to be used for 3D printers applications, and integrated in font package for convenience.

In many projects I handle, I always miss 3D printer related icons and even some network icons, so I decided to take time to build a set. 

Currently the base is 24x24 icon, if there is a need for bigger, I will do, but I think it is a good base. Number of icon will growing according the needs, so feel free to suggest missing ones.

The first set is simple and black. 
The idea is to have one place to store and improve icons, I am not graphical designer so be patient ^_^ , I need time to get the right design and master the inkscape application- the rendering should be ok fron 16px to 50px, so icons must be simple and meaningful. also I would like to convert the set to a font package so it could also be easily used with some SDK like [littlevgl](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_font_conv)
