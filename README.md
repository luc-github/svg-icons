3D Printer and related SVG icons

Set of icons designed with inkscape to be used for 3D printers applications, and integrated in font package for convenience.

In many projects I handle, I always miss 3D printer related icons and even some network icons, so I decided to take time to build a set. 

Currently the base is 24x24 icon, if there is a need for bigger, I will do.   

The first set is simple and black.
